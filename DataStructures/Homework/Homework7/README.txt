ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  < insert 6 hours >



ORDER NOTATION ANALYSIS (ORIGINAL VERSION W/MAPS):
of each of the costume shop operations (please be concise!)

addCostume: O(log(n)) has to see if the costume is already in the map

rentCostume: O(log(n)) only has to access certain costumes

lookup: O(c^2) nested for loop that runs through customers

printPeople: O(clog(c)) runs through the people map for a number of c times so the formatting is correct

do_action: O(c^2) uses all of the functions and lookup is the biggest one


EXTRA CREDIT (W/O MAPS)
What alternate data structures did you use?  What is the order
notation of each operation without maps?  What is the expected
performance difference?  Summarize the results of your testing.



MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  


my full diagram was too big for submitty, but it was a little repetitive so I just cropped the bottom part.
